# T2V - Traffic to Vehicle Communication System

Our senior design project is the design of a working prototype for a communication system between vehicle and traffic infrastructure for the improvement of traffic throughput and safety. The design consists of an interface for both vehicle and traffic infrastructure that would allow communication over Bluetooth. The location of each vehicle is determined by the traffic infrastructure via RFID readers and compatible RFID tags so that traffic flow can be controlled intelligently.
